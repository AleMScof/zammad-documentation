Feedback or contact forms are quite often used on websites. Usually they will generate an email which will be sent to somebody who forwards it and so on. With Zammad itâ€™s quite easy to integrate these forms into your website and directly generate tickets with them. In just 2 minutes.

Go to "Admin -> Channels -> Form" and enable the switch for this feature. Below you can adapt your form settings.
