Continuous integration
**********************

* All pushes to our main repo @ https://github.com/zammad/zammad will trigger build test on https://travis-ci.org.
* You can find the build results @ https://travis-ci.org/zammad/zammad
* If you fork the Zammad repo you can use travis-ci.org to get your builds tested
* Just change the file ".travis.yml" to fit your needs
