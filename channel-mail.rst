If you want to fetch emails via POP3 or IMAP you have to create a mail channel in system settings "#channels/email".

**If you're using a Office365 Mailbox, please ensure that it's a real usermailbox and not a shared mailbox!**

Just follow these steps:

* Click "New"
* Enter "Organization & Department Name"
* Enter "Email address"
* Enter "Password"
* Enter "Destination Group"
