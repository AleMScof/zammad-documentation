Mail
****

If you like to fetch mails via POP3 or IMAP you have to create a mail channel in system settings site "#channels/email".

From there its realy easy:

* Click "New"
* Enter "Organization & Department Name"
* Enter "EMAIL"
* Enter "PASSWORD"
* Enter "Destination Group"

Zammad trys to detect the POP3, IMAP & SMTP server settings automaticaly.
This should work most of the time.
If not use the "Experts" button to configure it by yourself.
